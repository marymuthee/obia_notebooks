# Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) – Segmentation, Feature Extraction, and Classification

This repository contains three Jupyter Notebooks developed as part of my Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) course. The notebooks demonstrate a complete OBIA workflow including segmentation, feature extraction, and classification.

The notebooks build on course-provided materials by Dr. Dirk Tiede, with additional functionalities implemented by me as described below.

## Segmentation Notebook

Additional functionalities implemented:
- Graph-based image segmentation
- Parameter experimentation and visualization for segmentation quality
- Comparative visualization of segmentation results

All other segmentation components follow the structure provided in the course material.

## Feature Extraction Notebook

Additional functionalities implemented:
- Object area computation
- Object perimeter computation
- Integration of area and perimeter into the segment feature table

All other feature extraction components follow the structure provided in the course material.

## Classification Notebook

Additional functionalities implemented:
- Support Vector Machine (SVM) object-based classification
- Cross-validation–based accuracy assessment for SVM
- Confusion matrix and classification report for SVM
- Mapping of SVM predictions back to raster space

Existing labeled training samples and Random Forest classification workflow were provided in the course material.
