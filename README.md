# Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) – Segmentation, Feature Extraction, and Classification

This repository contains three Jupyter Notebooks developed as part of my Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) course. The notebooks demonstrate a complete OBIA workflow including segmentation, feature extraction, and classification. 

The notebooks build on course-provided materials by Dr. Dirk Tiede, with additional functionalities implemented by me as described below.

## Segmentation Notebook

Additional functionalities implemented:
- Graph-based image segmentation
- Parameter experimentation and visualization for segmentation quality
- Comparative visualization of segmentation results

All other segmentation components follow the structure provided in the course material.

## Feature Extraction Notebook

Additional functionalities implemented:
- Custom spectral feature extraction (mean and standard deviation)
- Custom shape features (compactness, rectangularity/extent)
- Custom textural feature using NDVI entropy
- Consolidation of all extracted features into a single feature table

All other feature extraction components follow the structure provided in the course material.

## Classification Notebook

Additional functionalities implemented:
- Manual selection and labeling of training samples
- Support Vector Machine (SVM) object-based classification
- Cross-validation–based accuracy assessment
- Confusion matrix and classification report
- Mapping of SVM predictions back to raster space

All other classification components follow the structure provided in the course material.
